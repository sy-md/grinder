tinder for yours phots to manage


simple ideas from the google api

1:) use the ablums.list to get list of albums the user has
  * use the id from the albums in mediaitems.search
2:) with the id from step 1 will use the meidaitems.search and give it the id to get the albums content
3:) give the albums.batchremove the alubumsid the albums content media contenet id to be delted

then i get this protocal "No permission to remove media items from album because the album was not created by this app"

okay maybe we cant use this is delte my photos but we can move them to more organized and managable to delete bulk loads through my phone

so new idea is get the photos then create album called trash then move all 

so your cant really manipulate youll have to copy and have the api think its the orignal then remove
